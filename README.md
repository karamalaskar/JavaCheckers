# JavaCheckers ⚪️⚫️
My final project for the [Programming 3 (Java) course at BME](https://www.iit.bme.hu/oktatas/tanszeki_targyak/BMEVIIIAB00). It's a simple checkers game implemented in Java and Swing.

## How to run:
1. Compile the program with ```mvn compile```
2. Package the program with ```mvn package```
3. Run the program with ```mvn exec:java```
